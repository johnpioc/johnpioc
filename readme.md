# Hey, I'm John Pioc 👋🏼

I'm a second year computer science & mathematics student at the University of Queensland. 

I'm aspiring to break into quantitative finance as a software enginerr, therefore my coursework focuses on low-latency, high-performance computing such as operating systems, networks, low-level programming and compilers/interpreters.

Outside of university, I like to read computer-science textbooks to supplement my learning, competitive programming through LeetCode and Codeforces, and building personal projects centered about quantitative finance development and trading. 

**Skills:** C/C++, Java, Python, MySQL
